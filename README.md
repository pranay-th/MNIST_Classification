# MNIST_Classification
In this project, I have utilised the MNIST database availaible online.The database used consists of handwritten numbers from 0 to 9.There are 60000 samples
in the training set and 10000 in the test set.
The first model is a Convulutional Neural Network model using TensorFlow Keras.
The second is a Classification model made using Random forest.
The third is a Support Vector Classifier model.
The fourth is a K Nearest Neighbour classification model.
And the fifth is a XGBoost model.
All the models are classification models that classify the different numerical digits present in the database.Every model except CNN utilizes numerical data of 
the images present in a CSV file. The CNN model makes use of the images itself.
All models have >75% accuracy scores.
The confusion matrix for every model is also shown along with the accuracy.
